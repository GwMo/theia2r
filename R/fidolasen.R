# general functions to automatically perform all the operations
# (find, download, apply sen2cor, translate in vrt, compute indices,
# merge tiles, make other preprocessing operations, create final files,
# create virtual time series).
# this is possible in three ways:
# 1) manually specifying all the necessary parameters;
# 2) passing the path of a JSON settings file;
# 3) opening the shiny GUI.
